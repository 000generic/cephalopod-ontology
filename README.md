This is a 000generic fork of the initial cephalopod-ontology put together by Chris Mungall.

A web page for the project is at: http://000generic.github.io/cephalopod-ontology/

The original README.md is:

===================

Ontology of cephalopod anatomy and traits

The ontology is available from

  http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ceph.owl

You can find the source files in the [src/ontology/](https://github.com/obophenotype/cephalopod-ontology/tree/master/src/ontology) directory.

Adopt a cephalopod (ontology)!
----------------------------

This ontology was created from high level sources without the benefit
of domain expertise. We are looking for people to adopt or contribute
to this ontology!

Browse the ontology
-------------------

Currently, in order to browse the ontology it's necessary to load the
ontology into an environment such as obo-edit or protege. Web views
may be available soon.
